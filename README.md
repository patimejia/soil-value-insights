# High Land Value Identification Using Tax and Soil Data

This project aims to identify areas with high land value by integrating tax and soil data. The solution combines test-driven development (TTD), ETL processes, various SQL techniques, and calculations to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, you will need the following software and data:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- A SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite)
- Soil Data: A dataset containing information about soil quality, location, and other relevant attributes
- Tax Data: A dataset containing tax information about land value, property tax rates, and location

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/high-land-value.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd high-land-value
```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the SQL database and import the soil and tax data.

5. Update the configuration file (`config.py`) with the appropriate settings for your SQL database, including the connection string, table names, and location identifiers.

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script to perform the analysis:

```
python high_land_value.py
```

2. The script will generate a report (CSV, Excel, or JSON) with the identified high land value areas, including their Land Value Score and relevant attributes.

3. Optionally, visualize the results on a map using geospatial tools or libraries (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS, or a Python library like Geopandas).

## Running the Tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```
python -m unittest tests/test_high_land_value.py
```
